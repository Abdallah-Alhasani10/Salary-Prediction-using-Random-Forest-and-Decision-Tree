# Salary-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-and-Decision-Tree

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee salaries based on various features using **machine learning models**. Two popular regression models are implemented:

- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

The goal is to provide accurate salary predictions based on input features such as experience, education, and job role.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about employees, including:

- Years of experience
- Education level
- Job position
- Other relevant features

> Note: You can replace this with your dataset or provide a CSV file in the repository.

## Features
- `Experience` – Number of years of experience
- `Education` – Level of education (Bachelor, Master, etc.)
- `Job Role` – Position in the company
- `Other features` – Any additional factors affecting salary

## Models
1. **Decision Tree Regressor**  
   - Pros: Simple to interpret, handles non-linear data.  
   - Cons: Prone to overfitting if not properly tuned.

2. **Random Forest Regressor**  
   - Pros: Reduces overfitting, more accurate, ensemble of trees.  
   - Cons: Computationally heavier, harder to interpret.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdallah-Alhasani10/Salary-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-and-Decision-Tree.git
